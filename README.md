# Twitter-streaming
A REST API which streams Twitter data and stores them in a database.

Twitter Streaming API was used to stream real time twitter data based on some keywords. Also the number of tweets that you want to extract can be passed as a parameter to the function which implements streaming.

The streamed data was stored in a SQL Database on which some built-in queries as well as custom queries can be applied.

Also, the stored tweets in the database can be exported to a csv file for further analysis.
